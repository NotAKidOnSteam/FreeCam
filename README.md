# FreeCam
Free cam script for the Game view tab. Modified version of Unity FreeCam by ashleydavis for use with the VRChat Creator Companion.

# Import via VRChat Creator Companion or extract into normal Unity project manually.
# Drag FreeCam prefab from Samples folder into scene and make sure it is only camera.
(if it isnt the only camera, the VRChat SDK can be wonky with which it chooses to allow grabbing from)
