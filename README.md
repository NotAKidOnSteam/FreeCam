# FreeCam
Free cam script for the Game view tab. Modified version of Unity FreeCam by ashleydavis for use with the VRChat Creator Companion.

# How To Use:
**Import via VRChat Creator Companion as a User Package or extract ZIP into normal Unity project manually.**

**Drag FreeCam prefab from Samples folder into scene and make sure it is only camera.**

## Warning
More than one camera in your scene causes the VRChat SDK to be wonky with which it chooses to allow grabbing from.
Make sure to have only the FreeCam camera enabled before entering playmode to avoid bug.

In Play Mode, you should now be able to use WASD and scroll wheel to move the camera around.
